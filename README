Wordle game for cami :)
------------------------
This is a simple wordle game created using c++ and terminal to emulate the NYT wordle game.
It has a list of 5757 words it chooses the master word from, taken from https://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/sgb-words.txt.
As of 2/23/22 the game does not check length or validity of word, or keep a word bank of valid letters for the user to choose from.
